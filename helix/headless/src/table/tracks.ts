 * The first `wanted` tracks of a track list, one entry each, so every declared
 * column can take the one in its place.
 *
 * Split on the spaces between tracks and never inside a function, so
 * `minmax(0, 1fr)` stays one track. A `repeat()` with a count is that many
 * tracks, written out; an automatic one names no count and yields none. Line
 * names go with the track after them.
 *
 * Everything above the split is a fact about a grid track list rather than
 * about a value list, which is why only the split itself is shared.
 *
 * **A track the grid would refuse yields nothing either**, where the platform
 * can say. One invalid track makes the whole `grid-template-columns` invalid,
 * which a grid ignores in silence and draws as one column. That is the failure
 * that once had `columns` deprecated, a list of headings handed over as widths,
 * and dealt out a track at a time it costs the one column its width and no
 * more.
