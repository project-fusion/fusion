 * generic helper cannot be named by the manifest analyzer, which recorded the
 * parameter identifier and produced a phantom event on every element that
 * inherited it. Components dispatch concrete event classes from `events.ts`,
 * which the analyzer and TypeScript can both see.

   * `<helix-input>` hears nothing. Re-dispatching it from the host is what
   * makes the component behave like the control it wraps.
   *
   * The relayed event keeps the native name deliberately. `change` is `change`,
   * which is what a consumer already knows to listen for, and it is what
   * reaches React: its synthetic system claims `onChange` and wires it to that
   * name, so a prefixed one would never arrive.
   *
   * `composed` is not forced. It defaults to the original event's own value, so
   * a relayed `change` stops at the next shadow boundary exactly as a native
   * one would. Pass it explicitly only where escaping is the intent, and say so
   * where you do.
