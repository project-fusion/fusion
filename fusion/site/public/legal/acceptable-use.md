description: What the sandbox will run, what it will not, and why the limits are so few.
kicker: Acceptable use
path: /legal/acceptable-use
title: What you may run here
---

Last updated 26 August 2026. This covers `/helix/sandbox` and `/helix/theme`,
the two pages that execute code you write. It is short because the architecture
does most of the work that a policy would otherwise have to do in words.

## Your code does not run on our machine

The sandbox renders inside an iframe declared `sandbox="allow-scripts
allow-forms"` with `allow-same-origin` deliberately absent. Your code runs in
your browser against an opaque origin: it cannot read our storage, cannot call
our origin, and cannot reach anything of ours. Nothing you type is sent to a
server, which is why there is no submission to moderate and no stored artifact to
remove.

So most of what an acceptable use policy usually forbids is not forbidden here,
it is unreachable. We are not being generous. There is nothing to be generous
with.

## What is actually prohibited

Three things, and each one is a case the architecture does not already answer:

- **Do not use these pages to attack anyone**, including us. Scanning, probing,
  or using the frame as a step toward reaching some other system is out, however
  little of it can work.
- **Do not automate them at a scale that degrades them for other people.** The
  documentation is published as plain markdown beside every page and as
  `llms.txt`; that path is cheaper for you and for us than driving a browser.
- **Do not hold this out as yours.** Do not present the sandbox, or output from
  it, as a Fusion endorsement, and do not imply we reviewed something we have
  never seen.

## What we ask rather than require

**Do not paste a secret into the sandbox.** Not because we would read it, but
because you have no reason to take our word for that, and the habit is worth
keeping whatever the page. An API key in a code sample is a key in your clipboard
history, your browser session, and any screenshot you take afterwards.

## What we may do

We may change or withdraw either page at any time, and we may rate-limit or block
traffic that is degrading the site. There is no account to suspend and no content
to take down, so those are the only levers, and they are aimed at load rather
than at authorship.

## If this ever becomes hosting

Everything above holds because the sandbox is a page rather than a service. **If
Fusion ever runs the sandbox on someone else's behalf, storing their code or
executing it server-side, that is a different arrangement and it will need a
different policy**, along with terms about retention, deletion and the law that
applies to what is stored. Saying so now is cheaper than discovering it later.
